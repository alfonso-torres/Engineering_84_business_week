### Answers

- Answer 1: My name is Jose Alfonso. I am a graduate in computer Science. During my university stage I developed different projects but I would like to highlight the creation of an application in the platform Android studio developed in Java, as well as its repectic connection to the databasein MySQL. Other project that has helped to learn a lot of, it was the creation of a cluster and its respective configuration. For this project, I have managed the use of virtual machines with linux operatyng system, as well as shell and command language of bash script. I started of my career as a membur of DevOps Department in Spain. It was a internship during 6 months. I was envolved in projects related to the deployment of infrasctrucure and process of automation. To be able to do my tasks I have learnt skills related to the concepts of Red Hat Linux and Ansible tool.

- Answer 2: Agile describes a set of guiding principles that use an iterative approach to project or software development. Agile methodologies are those that allow adapting the way of working to the conditions of the project at all times. For Agile to be implemented, it takes into account processes and technologies. In the case of processes, these must seek customer satisfaction, while adapting to the culture of the company. They are beneficial for the reason that it is easy to accommodate changes at any time and phase of the project, it generates a lower cost and a shoerter work time and because changes can be adopted during the course of the project.

- Answer 3: As soon as I see that you provide the role of DevOps I applied directly. You help people providing a specifc training to speciliaze in the role that they would like to be. This is the best way because you make people to be ready to start a career on the labor market. When I finished my degree I felt that I need to be more professional and with your program I will achieve my goals.

- Answer 4: Scrum is a specific set of rules that must be followed while practicing software development. It is a process in thw way that a set of good practices is applied on a regular basis to work collaboratively, as a tema, and obtain the best possible result from a project. They are beneficial for the reason that make an alignment between the client and the development team, the team can work with flexibility and adaptation.

- Answer 5: During my professional career I hope to learn enough knowledge and the necessary experiences to become an example as a DevOps Engineer. I want to be a consultant capable of solving any problem. I would like my role to develop through the path of DevOps Architect, to be abelt to carry out the design and implementation of business apliccations. I hope to achieve my goal by participating in great projects with good teams that help me improve.

- Answer 6: DevOps is an acronym for development and operations, which refers to a software development methodology that focuses on communication, collaboration, and integration between software developers and IT professionals. The benefits of using it is that it involves multidisciplinary teams, continuos improvement is the core of this methodology and it is based on collaboration to get good results.

- Answer 7:
1. Scrum Master: The Scrum Master helps the product group learn and apply Scrum to achieve business value. The Scrum Master does whatever is in their power to help the Team, Product Owner and organization be successful. The Scrum Master is not the manager of the Team members, nor are they a project manager, team lead, or team representative. Instead, the Scrum Master serves the Team; he or she helps to remove impediments, protects the Team from outside interference, and helps the Team to adopt Agile development practices.
2. Product Owner: The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing return on investment (ROI) by identifying product features, translating these into a prioritized list, deciding which should be at the top of the list for the next Sprint, and continually re-prioritizing and refining the list. The Product Owner has profit and loss responsibility for the product, assuming it is a commercial product. Product Owner in Agile is like a spokesperson for customer and needs to represent them.
3. Development team: A Development Team is a collection of individuals working together to develop and deliver the requested and committed product increments. It comprises of cross-functional members who are capable of achieving the sprint goals. This could include software engineers, architects, programmers, analysts, system admins, QA experts, testers, UI designers, etc.

- Answer 8: These five events are:
1. Sprint Planning: This is the event that kick starts each Sprint and is where the Product Owner and Developers discuss which Product Backlog Items (PBI’s) will be included in Sprint
2. Daily Scrum: Scrum seeks to efficiently use your time and resources and the Daily Scrum event is no exception. The Daily Scrum is timeboxed to 15 minutes. Standing up is not compulsory. However, many teams find this a useful technique to keep the event short and to the point.
3. Sprint Review: A Sprint Review usually takes place on the last day of the Sprint and allows the Scrum Team the opportunity to show the Done Increment to stakeholders. As well as inspecting working features produced during the Sprint, you are also after useful feedback that can be incorporated the Product Backlog that may help guide the work for future sprints.
4. Sprint Retrospective: The final event in the Sprint is the Sprint Retrospective. This is when the Scrum Team reviews what could be improved for future Sprints and how they should do it.
5. The Sprint: The Sprint is an event in itself that contains all the work and all the other events that happen during the timeboxed period of development.

- Answer 9: The Agile consists of four key values:
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: Having the right group of individuals on your software team is vital to success. Perhaps even more important is how these individuals communicate with each other. The interactions between team members are what helps them to collaborate and solve any problems that arise.
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation: The Agile places shipping software to your customers as one of the highest priorities. And while documentation isn’t a bad thing, there comes a point when you should focus on providing your customers with working software.
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: According to the Agile, the focus should be on continuous development. You need to build a feedback loop with your customers so that you can constantly ensure that your product works for them. You would draw up contracts with your customers who would then detail the finished product.
4. Responding to change over following a plan: That’s why the Agile suggests that a software team should have the ability to pivot and change direction whenever they need to, with a flexible roadmap that reflects that.

- Answer 10: Agile scrum artifacts are information that a scrum team and stakeholders use to detail the product being developed, actions to produce it, and the actions performed during the project. These artifacts provide metadata points that give insight into the performance of a sprint. The main agile scrum artifacts are product backlog, sprint backlog, and increments. The product backlog is a list of new features, enhancements, bug fixes, tasks, or work requirements needed to build a product. The sprint backlog is a set of product backlog tasks that have been promoted to be developed during the next product increment. A product increment is the customer deliverables that were produced by completing product backlog tasks during a sprint. It also includes the increments of all previous sprints.

## <u>SQL</u>

***Q&A***

- __Question 1: What is a JOIN function?__<br/>
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. SQL JOIN two tables related by a single column primary key or foreign key. The different types of JOINs in SQL are:
1. INNER JOIN: returns records that have matching values in both tables.
2. LEFT JOIN: returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table.
3. RIGHT JOIN: returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table.
4. FULL JOIN: returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

- __Question 2: What is a primary key and foreign key? What are their functions?__<br/>
The primary key is a specific choice of a minimal set of attributes (columns) or only one attribute that uniquely specify a tuple (row) in a relation (table). A primary key must be unique. The value must never change. Each table may have a maxium of one primary key. Must walways have an entry, can not be NULL. It can be simple or compound. Simple corresponds only one field.Or composite, that combines more than one field (column). 
The foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the primary key in another table. It is a referential limitation between tables. So they are used to create solid relationships. There is not uniqueness constraint for foreign keys. A table is allowed to contain more than one foreign key. Also, it is OK from them to contain NULL values.

- __Question 3: What is DML and DDL?__<br/>
They are structured query language. Is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system.
1. Data Manipulation Language (DML): used for adding, deleting and modifying data in database. -> SELECT, INSERT UPDATE and DELETE.
2. Data Definition Language (DDL): used for creating and modifying database objects suchs as tables, indices and users. -> CREATE, ALTER, DROP and TRUNCATE.

- __Question 4: What is Normalisation?__<br/>
Normalisation is the process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. Types of normalization:
1. First Normal Form (1NF): make everything atomic. There should be not repeating groups.
2. Second Normal Form (2NF): Be in 1NF. All non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key. There should be no partial dependency.
3. Third Normal Form (3NF): Be in 2NF. It does not have transitive dependency.

- __Question 5: What is Entity relationship diagram and benefit of using it?__<br/>
An entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationship of entity sets stored in a database. Is a type of structural diagram for use in database design. It contains different symbols and connectors: the entities and the inter-relationships among these entities. To fully utilize ER Diagram in database engineering guarantees you to produce high-quality database design to use in database creation, management, and maintenance. An ER model also provides a means for communication.

## <u>What is Git and Git-hub and benefit of using it?</u>

- Git is a version control software, thinking about the efficiency, reliability and compatibility of the maintenance of versions of applications. The purpose is to keepp the track of changes in computer files including coordinating the work that various people do.
- Git-hub is a online repository. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. All is saved on a cloud. <br/><br/>
Regarding the benefits, it makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects, it makes it easier to get excellent documentation, it is a repository that allows your work go get out there in front of the public and it can track changes in your code across versions (Everything changed is tracked). It helps us to get back(recover) to any change becuase it is a TECHNICAL BACKUP CLOUD.

## <u>PYTHON</u>

***Q&A***

- __Question 1: What is Python and benefit of using it?__<br/>
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive fo Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. So for that reason it supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and functional programming. <br/>
The benefit of using it, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance, it supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code re-use. But for the reason that Python is object-oriented, it supports with thousands of libraries that you can use in your own work. Python has an enormous user community. <br/>
Python is a great language for scripting, deployment automation, and web development. This makes it one of the most suitable langauges for DevOps currently. It is highly demanded. Python helps achieve the same through a wide array of libraries and packages, accesibility, and flexibility. So Pyython is a scripting language, and it can be used in many different ways for many different types oj jobs. DevOps and Python is one such rare combination that promises agility, giving us an edge over ours competitors. DevOps and Python makes things simpler and help to transform with the new technologies in the market rigth now.

- __Question 2: What is OOP and why should we use it?__<br/>
Object-Oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by building related properties and behaviors into individual objects. Let's have a look at an initial example. Imagine that you have to describe a car to someone who's never seen one before. You may want to start telling that it's a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Also you would like to mention that there are several brands of cars, or some aspects like it has four tires that they carry up to five people. So Computers have no natural thought of what a car is, why were they made or who employments them. And in the event that you need your computer to accurately get it the protest, a car in this case, you have got to clearly clarify which are its attributes and what functions they will do. For that reason Python uses a programming pattern called object-oriented programming, which models concepts using classes and objects. <br/>
It is a flexible, powerful paradign where we can use classes which represent and denife concepts that we want to show to the customers. It makes complex code easier to develop, more relieable, more maintainable and it lets you change the implementation of an object without affecting any other code, so for that reason we should use it.Also it helps us to follow the concept of DRY. The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle is a common principle across programming paradigms, but it is especially important in OOP. According to the principle: Every piece of knowledge or logic must have a single, unambiguous representation within a system. It could be a guideline of computer program improvement pointed at decreasing redundancy of computer program designs, supplanting it with reflections or utilizing information normalization to maintain a strategic distance from excess.

- __Question 3: The benefits of OOP and best use cases?__<br/>
It is exceptionally valuable for the reason that it permits you to bundle together information states and functionality to alter those information states, whereas keeping the subtle elements hidden away. As a result, code with OOP plan is adaptable, measured, and abstract. So this makes it especially valuable after you make bigger programs. <br/>
The benefits of OOP are:
1. It lets you change the implementation without affecting any other code.
2. It allows you to have different functions with the same name and functionality but on different data.
3. It allows you write generic that will work with a range of data without knowing how it is defined.
4. It lets you write a set of attributes and functions that will expand them in different ways without copying in any way. <br/><br/>
An example of use case we can continue with the same example of the above question. The concept of object-oriented programming comes down to attributes(the characteristics associated to a type) and methods(the functions associated to a type) associated with a type. In the car example, the color and brand are two attribute associated with every car, so we can define this two attributes in the Car class. On the other hand, methods would be actions perfomed by the car, such as driving. So every instance created in the program will have the attributes of `color` and `brand` and the function `driving`.

- __Question 4: What is an API and why should we use it?__<br/>
API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, that means software intermediary that allows two applications to talk each other within the API. So is a set of programing code that enables data transmission between one software product and another. Let's see a simple example: Imagine that you are in a restaurant, siting at a table with a menu of choices to order. So the kitchen is the part of the system that will prepare your order. But we need something to link the communication between the kitchen and the customer to deliver the food. Here is when the waiter comes in. The waiter will be the messenger (API) that takes your requests and tells the kitchen and then come back with your food. <br/>
The benefits of using API are:
1. Better integration: you can integrate your applications with third parties in order to optimize their functionality and to improve usability.
2. Automating tasks: Thanks to automation and integration of processes your business can save costs, time and efforts.
3. Improved services: APIs simplify the implementation of new applications, business models and digital products and allow an effective complementation with third-party products or services whilst improving their development.

![HTTP_API](https://github.com/alfonso-torres/Engineering_84_business_week/blob/main/API_HTTP.png)

- __Question 5: What are Python Packages and Modules? - Requests module use case with API__<br/>
A Python package is a collection of modules, a simple directory of Python modules that contains differentes scripts. On the other hand, modules that are related to each other are mainly put in the same package. When a module from an external package is required in a program, that package can be imported and its modules can be put to use. So a package saves modules and this modules contains executables statements as well as function definitions that we will be able to use in any program.<br/>
Let's see an example:
````python
import requests # Module request

# API to ask the user what website they want to check its status
website = input("Please enter the website you would like to check his status (INCLUDE the http//): ") 

# Function to check if the website is working or not
def status_code_check(name):
    responses = requests.get(name)

    if responses.status_code == 200:
        return ("This website is up and running, status code is: " + str(responses.status_code))
    else:
        return ("OOPs something went wrong, status code is: " + str(responses.status_code))

print(status_code_check(website))
````
- __Question 6: What is pip?__<br/>
Pip is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python. As we know a package contains all the files you need for a module. So this modules are Python code libraries that you can include in your project. <br/>
To check if pip is installed, type the following command:
````
pip --version
````
To install PIP in the case do not have pip installed, you can download and install it from this [link](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).<br/>
To download a package, we type the following commnad:
````
pip install name_package
````
To see the differents packages that you can install and their documentations, use this [link](https://docs.python.org/3/library/).<br/>
To list all the packages installed on your system:
````
pip list
````
- __Question 7: What are four pillars of OOP and why should we use them? - Use cases included__<br/>
You can apply OOP in your code with classes and objects. All the objects
you create will have states and functionality.<br/>
There are four major benefits to OOP. There are four pillars:
1. *Abstraction*:

By using classes, you will be able to generalize your objects types, simplifying 
  your program. So as a developer we will show only the essential features of the
  application and hiding the details from the user. Let's see an example:
````python
class Animal():

    def __init__(self): # self refers the current class
        self.alive = True
        self.spine = True

    def eat(self):
        return " keep eating to stay alive "
        
# Creating an object of our Animal class
cat = Animal() # this will store all the data available in Animal class into cat
print(cat.eat())  # eat() is Abstraction
# THE USER DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING BEHIND
````
2. *Encapsulation*:

In OOP, you bundle code into a single unit where you can determine the scope of 
each piece of data. It means that is all about binding the data variables and 
functions together in class. It helps us to make data private from the customer.
Let's see an example:
````python
# Creating a Snake class
class Snake(Reptile):

    def __init__(self):
        # Protected member
        self.__fork_tongue = True

# Creating an object of our Snake class
snake_object = Snake()
print(snake_object.__fork_tongue)
# It will result in Attribute Error because we made the attribute __fork_tongue private
# So we can see that it is encapsulated to the user
````  
3. *Inheritance*:

A class can inherit attributes and behaviors from another class, so we will be able
to reuse more code. The class which is inherited from, is called the base class, and the class 
which inherits the code from the base class is called a Parent class. Let's see an example:
````python
# Creating an Animal class
class Animal():

    def __init__(self): # self refers the current class
        self.alive = True

    def breath(self):
        return " keep breathing if you want to live"

# Let's import Animal class

from animal import Animal # this is to ensure Animal class is inherited
class Reptile(Animal): # We need to pass the animal class as an arg in our Reptile class

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__() # super is to make everything available from parent class
        self.cold_blooded = True

    def hunt(self):
        return " working hard to catch the next meal "

# Let's see amazing benefits of inheritance
reptile_object = Reptile()
# We can use the method "breath()" from the class Animal() because is inherited
print(reptile_object.breath())

````
4. *Polymorphism*:

One class can be used to create many objects, all from the same flexible piece of code.
So you can inherit from parent class as well as override the data. It allows us to create
attributes and methods with the same name which will perform differently. Let's see an example:
````python
# Creating an Snake class
class Snake(Reptile):

    def __init__(self):
        self.venom = True

# Let's import Snake class
from snake import Snake # this is to ensure Snake class is inherited
class Python(Snake): # We need to pass the Snake class as an arg in our Python class

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        self.venom = False # Polymorphism

# Creating an object of our Python class
python_object = Python()
print(python_object.venom)
# It will print "False". We inherit the attribute "venom" from our Parent class.
# But in the Python class we are overriden this attribute.
# So the program will use the attribute from this class, not from Parent class.
````

The benefits of using the four pillars, apart form what we have seen previously, the code is more easier to read and understand since it is all grouped into objects. This code can be reusable and easiert to maintain. And finally testing is going to be more easier when we will be working with objects.

- __Question 8: What is CRUD?__<br/>
CRUD is the acronym for "Create, Read, Update and Delete", which is used to refer to the basic functions in databases or the persistence layer in a software. Basically, the CRUD Operations in Python is written in python programming language and MySQL database. For any application which is associated with a database, we perform some operations for inserting the record (C=Create), reading the records (R=Read), updating the existing record with new value (U=Update) or deleting the record from the database (D=Delete]). So, These four operations are essentials when talking about any application where we have to use a database. For that reason we will have a persistent database. In the context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data survives after the process with which it was created has ended. In other words, for a data store to be considered persistent, it must write to non-volatile storage.

- __Question 9: What is TTD and benefit of implementing it?__<br/>
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free. TDD is widely used and is the cheapest way to test code or implement test driven development. In Python we will use Pytest to implement TDD. </br>

![TDD_SCHEME](https://github.com/alfonso-torres/Engineering_84_business_week/blob/main/TDD.png)

The benefits of implementing it are:
1. A key benefit of test-driven development is that it makes the developer focus on requirements before writing code. This is in contrast with the usual practice, where unit tests are only written after code.
2. Using TDD you build up, over time, a suite of automated tests that you and any other developer can rerun at will.
3. Better Designed, cleaner and more extensible code.
4. Confidence to Refactor: If you refactor code, there can be possibilities of breaks in the code. So having a set of automated tests you can fix those breaks before release.
5. TDD helps reduce the unexpected errors and the code becomes clearer and simple to understand.
- __Question 10: What is PYODBC and benefit of implementing it?__<br/>
Pyodbc is an open source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases simple. Using pyodbc, you can easily connect Python applications to data sources with an ODBC driver. We use PYODBC to establish a connection between Python and SQL. The PYODBC library will help us to connect to an AWS hosted database that is using SQL Server by Microsoft.

![PYODBC](https://github.com/alfonso-torres/Engineering_84_business_week/blob/main/Python_with_SQL.png)

The benefits of implmeneting it are:
1. Slightly less likely to contain memory allocation issues.
2. Simpler to maintain; a higher-level language means less lines of code.
3. Making data persistent: Persistence is "the continuance of an effect after its cause is removed". In the context of storing data in a computer system, this means that the data survives after the process with which it was created has ended. In other words, for a data store to be considered persistent, it must write to non-volatile storage. Persistent data in the field of data processing denotes information that is infrequently accessed and not likely to be modified. It means that we will always have the data in the database available anywhere in the world and whenever we want it. And also we can apply CRUD ("Create, Read, Update and Delete"), which is used to refer to the basic functions in databases or the persistence layer in a software.
- __Question 11: What is HTTP protocol and benefit of implementing it?__<br/>
HTTP is a client-server protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.
Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.

![HTTP_PROTOCOL](https://github.com/alfonso-torres/Engineering_84_business_week/blob/main/HTTP.png)

Benefits of implementing it are:
1. Addressing: HTTP uses advanced scheme of addressing. It assigns IP address with recognizable names so that it can be identified easily in the World Wide Web.
2. Security: In HTTP each files is downloaded from an independent connection and then gets closed.
3. Flexibility: Whenever there are additional capabilities needed by an application, HTTP has the capability to download extensions or plugins and display the relevant data.

- __Question 12: How can we use "Exception Handling" in Python?__<br/>
When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message. These exceptions can be handled using the `try` statement:
````python
try:
  print(x)
except:
  print("Something went wrong")
finally:
  print("The 'try except' is finished")
````
1. The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors.
2. The `except` block lets you handle the error.
3. The `finally` block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.

## <u>DevOps Interview Questions</u>

***Q&A***

- __Question 1: What is DevOps?__<br/>

DevOps is an acronym for development and operations, which refers to a software development methodology that focuses on communication, collaboration, and integration between software developers and IT professionals, in order that they can build, test, and release software faster participating together in the entire service life-cycle. In simple terms, DevOps is a culture that bridges the gap between development and operation teams.
The benefits of using it is that it involves multidisciplinary teams, continuos improvement is the core of this methodology and it is based on collaboration to get good results.

- __Question 2: Why do you want become a DevOps Engineer/Consultant?__<br/>

One of my greatest passions is to manufacture software faster, with higher quality, lower cost and a very high frequency of releases. Being able to control the quality of the process and the software product for the satisfaction of clients services. Making a true difference in the lives of my clients and their projects motivates me to strive for excellence in everything I do. In addition, in the last year of my degree, I had the opportunity to do an internship as a member of the devops department involved in projects related to process automation and infrastructure deployment. I helped the department explore options for reducing implementation failure and recovery time. I provided ideas that contributed to problem solving, managing my time and following work methodologies according to the scope of the project. I want to develop my technical and consultant skills to be able to be a problem solver.

DevOps is prone to continuous developments and enhancements, making it an exciting time to join the profession, it is something that motivates me not to stop learning and because make a real business impact, one of the main drivers for DevOps Engineers is the opportunity to truly deliver tangible business outcomes within the role.

- __Question 3: Explain the role of a DevOps Eng/Consultant__<br/>

Building and setting up new development tools and infrastructure. Understanding the needs of stakeholders and conveying this to developers. Working on ways to automate and improve development and release processes. testing and examining code written by others and analysing results. Assist the Professional Services team to develop offerings including proven architectures, proofs of concept, and best practices for delivery. Utilize a variety of tools, techniques, and procedures to resolve problems. Assist and support team members in executing projects on time.

DevOps is breaking down silos and bringing developers and operations closer together to work together, share responsibilities, deploy infrastructure as code and automate the deployment pipeline as much as possible, supported by strong seek practices. In turn, this will deliver faster time to market, improved team collaboration, continuous release cycles, automated and scalable environments, and most importantly increased quality due to automated testing throughout.

- __Question 4: What is Cloud Computing and why should we use it?__<br/>

Cloud computing is a term used to describe the use of hardware and software delivered via network (usually the Internet). The term comes from the use of cloud shaped symbol that represents abstraction of rather complex infrastructure that enables the work of software, hardware, computation and remote services. Cloud computing is based on the premise that the main computing takes place on a machine, often remote, that is not the one currently being used. Data collected during this process is stored and processed by remote servers (also called cloud servers). This means the device accessing the cloud doesn't need to work as hard. By hosting software, platforms, and databases remotely, the cloud servers free up the memory and computing power of individual computers. Users can securely access cloud services using credentials received from the cloud computing provider.

By using cloud infrastructure, you don't have to spend huge amounts of money on purchasing and maintaing equipment. Cloud offers many advanced security features that guarantee that data is securely stored and handled. Cloud based solutions are ideal for businesses with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. If your business demands increase, you can easily increase your cloud capacity without having to invest in physical infrastructure (Scalability).

(Cloud computing, also known as cloud services, cloud computing, computing cloud or simply "the cloud", is a paradigm that allows computing services to be offered through a network, which is usually the internet.)

## <u>Tips for interview</u>

- Be yourself, speak naturally. Don't try to remember everything you want to say. If you forgot something you want to mention, nothing happens, but always be yourself.

- Try to see the scene: why are they asking me that? What do they want to know? -> They want to know what I have done, how I have done it, how I have handled it, did I enjoy doing that? What has the result been? -> Take more personal. In each answer try to say something that can describe you.

Example:

- RM meeting blocker

- Organise with a document
- Discussed issue with boss
- Asked for advice
- "Leave it with me"

- Discussed grouping teams together
- Outcome all moved to afternoon so teaching is in morning

- Techniques:

1. Although I have written answers to each question, don't try to remember everything because in the end it will be noticed that you are not being natural. Try to write small words that help you remember the answer, small points with which you can respond in a more natural way.

2. Use the STAR Interview Response Method. Listen to the question and think of an event. S(situation): describe the event or situation that you were in. T(task): explain the task you had to complete. A(Action): describe the specific actions you took to complete the task. R(Result): close with the result of your efforts.

As they're asking the question, think about how you will respond.
Take a moment to think about your strategy and compose yourself.
STAR:

What is a Situation that fits the question?
What was the Task you have to complete?
What Action did you undertake to resolve that?
What was the Result of that?

- If we don't know the answer, what should I do?

Some answer: I do not remembet that on the top of my mind. I will do research and will come back with you. I am not 100% certain of this.

Always be honest, do not push yourself.

- If you have no clue - listen to it, ask them to elaborate.
- Still don't know - I'm not 100% certain on this, I can come back to you after some research.
- You don't remember it all - Say what you did, but you can come back to it after some research.
- Things you haven't covered - say what you will plan to cover and say you can get back once you have covered it.
- Be honest - don't make up answers. You won't get anywhere and might get caught out on it.
- If, for example, they ask us about our final project, and we are not happy about it, nothing happens, the important thing is to comment on how we have elaborated it, try to take it personally, that they see how you have faced the project, how you have organized it, If you have looked for information on your own, how you have solved the problems and what the result has been, it does not matter if you are proud of it or not, try to take it more personally, that with your answer they can know more about you.

- Have enough sleep and rest and breaks.
- Dont be tired or hungry or want to go to the loo.
- Try to be as relaxed as possible.
- Dress professionally to show you made an effort. Present yourself.
- Ask yourself: how will you be perceived on the other side of the interview. \strive for passionate, professional, motivated.
- Think positively.
- Be in the right mindset.
- Be comfortable in your attire, try it before buying it or before the interview.

- HOW I AM GOING TO PERCEIVE IN THE OTHER SIDE. BE SURE. GET READY. SET YOURSELF. BE IN THE MIND SELF. ASK MY SELF HOW I AM GOING TO BE PERCEIVED ON THE OTHER SIDE. BE POSITIVE. MAKE SURE YOURSELF BECAUSE IF NOT, YOU WILL NOT BE CONFORMTABLE WITH YOURSELF AND YOU CAN NOT PASS.

MOST IMPORTANT THING: BELIEVE IN YOURSELF. POSITIVE MINDING BEFORE THE INTERVIEW. BE SURE OF YOURSELF. THAT YOU ARE THE BEST CANDIDATE. THAT YOU ARE SURE YOU WILL PASS THE INTERVIEW.
